# Adding Memory Allocators to Our Basic Kernel

We have added 4 types of allocators to the kernel from previous in-class assingnments:

* Naive pageframe allocator
* Buddy System
* Slob Allocator
* User-space allocator

Please boot the images found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nmzeWui9nCd4qzYe4J_rRh2Uo_A4tLRK?usp=sharing) using virtual box. Each image provides the output of a small evaluation test for one of the above allocators (excluding the naive allocator).
